    <h1>All of Me</h1>
    <h2>John Legend</h2>
    <p class="lyrics">
      What would I do without your smart mouth?<br>
      Drawing me in and you kicking me out<br>
      You've got my head spinning, no kidding<br>
      I can't pin you down<br>
      <br>
      What's going on in that beautiful mind?<br>
      Making me feel like I've been locked out of heaven<br>
      For too long, for too long<br>
      <br>
      And I've been running after you<br>
      I've been running after you<br>
      I've been running after you<br>
      I've been running after you<br>
      <br>
      You've got my heart and soul in your hand<br>
      And I'm singing the songs that I've known since I was young<br>
      The songs that I've sung, oh, oh<br>
      <br>
      And I'm giving you all, all of me<br>
      And I'm loving you more, more than this<br>
      Song needs to be, needs to be written<br>
      And I'm giving you all, all of me<br>
    </p>
